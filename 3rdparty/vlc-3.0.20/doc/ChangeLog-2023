    caopengllayer: restore vout_display_SendEventDisplaySize
    
    VLC 4.0 doesn't need that but 3.0 still has no windowing module, leading
    to display size not being reported to the subtitle text renderer, and
    leading to blurry subtitles and OSD.
    
    Because the size is coming from the display, it means that the first
    time the subtitle is displayed, it will always be blurry depending on
    the real display size and original media size.

    mmdevice: move MTA initialization to the worker thread
    
    MTA was checked in the Open function. As this function is called from libvlc
    thread, this implies that a user of libvlc should have its own thread in MTA
    which may not be possible for various reasons.
    
    * MuteSet, VolumeSet, Play, DeviceSelect, Close callback don't require MTA
    * Flush, Pause and Start callbacks still require MTA, but as these functions are
      called from VLC internal threads this is a lesser issue

    darwin: redirect VLC_PKG_LIB_DIR/plugins on iOS
    
    On iOS and tvOS, dylibs must be wrapped into a framework and frameworks
    must be flattened into the frameworks/ application directory (or global
    to the system which is not possible in the general case), so dylibs
    can't be in the VLC_PKG_LIB_DIR/plugins folder. Redirect
    VLC_PKG_LIB_DIR/plugins toward VLC_PKG_LIB_DIR/ on those platforms.
    
    Manual cherry-pick from commit 89e90672db4a10243ae802c32272da8c062bc7bb.
    The code is written directly in the src/modules/bank.c code given that
    config_GetSysPath doesn't exist in 3.0.

    bank: add support for browsing frameworks
    
    Darwin platforms are using frameworks to embed libraries. Some of them
    like iOS and tvOS even forbid the use of dynamic libraries that are not
    wrapped into a framework.
    
    Since frameworks can contain various things (headers, resources, etc),
    we don't necessarily want to browse their whole tree if their structure
    is well-defined. In our case, since plugins are bundles and not dylibs,
    there's not linking and there's no point in supporting versionning so we
    can expect the plugin's dynamic library in the root of the framework,
    named like the framework without the .framework part.
    
    Since MacOSX can also make use of frameworks, this is enabled for all
    darwin platforms, though it might not use them.

    test: add iosvlc.m for iOS development
    
    iosvlc.m provides a binary usable as an iOS application, forwarding the
    VLC arguments just like VLC on desktop. It allows easier iteration on
    vlccore development for iOS, without the need to test in a VLCKit
    application like VLC for iOS or new external application.
    
    It is currently designed for usage with dynamic plugins.
    
    To develop with it, you must generate a .ipa archive containing both
    the resulting binary as executable, a PkgInfo file, an Info.plist file
    describing the package and the libs (libvlc.dylib, libvlccore.dylib, and
    every plugin .dylib or additional convenience libraries that are not
    linked statically in the Frameworks/ directory. It must then be signed
    with a developer certificate allowed by Apple and provisionned with a
    mobileprovision file allowing installation on the given device for the
    same developer certificate.
    
    Then, tools like libimobiledevice can be used to start the application
    with additional arguments or environment variables. They can also be
    added in XCode through the "Edit Scheme" menu.
    
    A big part of the iOS-specific code has been originally written by
    Marvin Scholz in a more complete libVLC ios sample.

    package: apple: backport build script for iOS
    
    The build script allows building for iOS/tvOS without pulling the whole
    VLCKit project, to build a standalone library for integrating libvlc in
    applications.
    
    The main goal is being able to maintain libVLC 3.0 without requiring the
    whole VLCKit environment to run tests.

    codec: Makefile.am: remove AudioUnit for audiotoolboxmidi
    
    AudioUnit framework is not found on iOS and is not needed on MacOSX.
    
    Cherry-picked from commit f68267079d9e9450d290fab486be6e4b825cea33.
    Manual change where AudioUnit is still needed in this version of the
    plugin for OSX.

    audio_output: Makefile.am: fix audiounit_ios link
    
    Remove AudioUnit framework as it is not found on iOS and only
    AudioToolbox is needed.
    
    In addition CoreServices cannot be linked for the iOS/tvOS targets as it
    is available starting with iOS/tvOS 12.0+.

    video_filter: Makefile.am: fix ci_filters's LDFLAGS
    
    The libci_filter_plugin_la_LDFLAGS must always contains the value of
    $(AM_LDFLAGS) since it is at least defined once. Otherwise, automake
    won't automatically define it to $(AM_LDFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) and the plugin
    won't be built correctly (ie, built as a convenience library because of
    the lack of -rpath definition in LDFLAGS).
    
    In addition, the frameworks were not correctly set for iOS, which was
    not a problem in static build because there is no linkage, nor in
    dynamic build before because the plugin was built as a convenience
    library, thus not linked nor installed to the device with the bundle
    script.
    
    Since the frameworks are mostly common between MacOSX and iOS, just add
    the corresponding OpenGL framework for each target, and define the other
    frameworks out of any automake condition.
    
    Cherry-picked from commit c82c99522446be5f50296721d5716ae604eed426 but
    partially modified to remove OpenGL/ES frameworks that are not needed
    without the commit cb6b1d5fb6c28893479f737a94da2bc753cbe8b9.

    demux: ts: fix seek issues in some streams
    
    Fixes #27646
    
    Currently, VLC's SeekToTime algorithm for MPEG Transport Streams involves a number of arbitrary restrictions when searching for PCR timestamps. It rejects packets whose PIDs are not included in the current program and it also rejects packets that do not contain a payload as well as packets that do not contain the payload start indicator.
    
    However, per the official documentation describing the MPEG-TS format (ITU-T H.222.0 version 7.0) there are no such restrictions placed on where the PCR can be set (nor are there official recommendations on it). It specifies that the PCR is part of the adaptation field, and it's perfectly valid to make a packet with "adaptation field only" and no payload.
    
    References:
     * Chapter 2.4.3.3:
       - Table 2-3: "The transport packets with PID values 0x0000, 0x0001, and 0x0010-0x1FFE are allowed to carry a PCR."
       - Table 2-5: "'10': Adaptation_field only, no payload"
       - Table 2-6: PCR is an optional part of the adaptation field, see 2.4.3.5 for details
     * Chapter 2.4.4.10: See PCR_PID
    
    Our observation of the existing algorithm is that the restrictions on the contents of the packet and the type of stream are intended more for the subsequent "ParsePESHeader" call, as those restrictions make sense when using that mechanism as a fallback method to find the PCR. However, by including these restrictions prior to the line that gets the PCR if "p_pmt->i_pid_pcr == i_pid", it's rejecting packets that could have otherwise provided PCR information.
    
    By moving the restrictions to later within the algorithm, we allow for any packets containing a matching PCR_PID to potentially supply that PCR information. This resolves seeking issues on any video that was created with PCRs set on packets without payloads.

    avcodec: add a hardware-only lavc AV1 video decoder with higher priority
    
    The priority is higher than dav1d so it can handle hardware decoding even if
    dav1d is present.
    
    This version of lavc should only allow decoding if the decoder has a profile
    that can be decoded by the hardware, otherwise it should let other decoders try
    to do the decoding (dav1d, lavc with current priority, etc).

    avcodec: add a flag to only allow hardware decoding for the decoder
    
    Only use 1 decoder thread when allowing only hardware decoders.
    
    Restarting the decoder silently is not allowed. Either we can reuse the va or
    we need to reload the decoder outside of lavc.

    packetizer:av1: detect sequence header changes
    
    When the sequence header changes we need to know it has changed so the output
    values can be reset.
    
    In particular the visible size was not reset since it was set initially by the
    demuxer. The first sequence header received is still not used to overwrite the
    visible size after this patch.
    
    The extra data were not reset even though they contain the sequence header.
    
    Because there changes were not detected the new output format is never
    forwarded.
    
    Fixes #26811

    contrib: soxr: fix neon detection for aarch64 hosts
    
    What we have :
    Given the cmake simd detection module check `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` to match "arm" prefixed hosts
    When `DETECT_SIMD32_C_FLAGS` test is performed by cmake for aarch64 Darwin hosts
    The test fails and `WITH_CR32S` is defined to 0 in `soxr-config.h`
    
    What is expected :
    Given the cmake simd detection module check `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` to match "aarch64" hosts
    When `DETECT_SIMD32_C_FLAGS` test is performed by cmake for aarch64 Darwin hosts
    The test succeeds and `WITH_CR32S` is defined to 1 in `soxr-config.h`
    
    When soxr is used on Darwin arm64 platforms (iOS, macOS on Apple Silicon), the expected resampler engine to be used is cr32s.
    Without this patch, cr32 is used instead, because in `soxr-config.h`, `WITH_CR32S` is defined to 0.
    Considering we use "aarch64" for Darwin arm64 hosts in contribs, these changes are an attempt to fix this.

    package/win32: build.sh: force Win XP SP1 compatibility
    
    Recent mingw64 with gcc12 (Debian) defaults to Windows 10. We need to force
    the toolchain to use only WinXP API's (apart from local overrides).
    
    This reverts d3ee976c416212924fb2f97bae2bd6c946bbddb5 but forces the proper
    minimum version for 3.0.

    taglib: wav: fix RIFF INFO tags parsing
    
    TagLib does not provide an union of both ID3v2 and INFO tags via the
    usual `File::tag()` method. Their justification lies in the code for
    now:
    
    ```cpp
    /*!
     * Returns the ID3v2 Tag for this file.
     *
     * \note This method does not return all the tags for this file for
     * backward compatibility.  Will be fixed in TagLib 2.0.
     */
    ID3v2::Tag *tag() const;
    ```
    
    To support WAV files providing RIFF INFO tags, we must specifically
    parse them before TagLib 2.0 (not released yet).

    According to https://web.archive.org/web/20080828095706/https://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/temp/power-management-spec-0.2.html the correct service name does not include `.Inhibit` and the path includes `/Inhibit`.

    qt: plugins: reset selection when reloading extensions
    
    When selecting an extension and reloading them afterwards, the selection
    points to invalid data but still represent a valid index for Qt, so the
    button More Information is still clickable and will lead to a crash.
    
    Reset the selection when reloading to prevent that.

    contrib: breakpad: Fix build with newest Xcode

    warnings.

    vout_opengl: add compatibility alias for libplacebo v5
    
    This fixes compilation for now, albeit with many deprecation warnings.
    It will probably break again whenever libplacebo v6 drops these
    deprecated fields as well, but hopefully VLC v4 will be released by
    then.
